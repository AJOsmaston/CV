#### Quick Learner

During my time at Wego Couriers, I researched and conducted a full scale profit vs. loss business analysis upon request from our CEO, and was given one month to complete the task. At Makers, for our [final project](https://life-of-bernard.herokuapp.com/), I learnt how to use passport.js and Express in the space of two days. I learnt this without it being taught on the course and implemented it so that our Node backend could communicate with our Heroku hosted React frontend, on https.

#### Succinct and Eloquent Communicator

Whether it be clients, customers, members of the general public or conversing with peers, I am able to clearly articulate my thoughts in a polite and thoughtful manner. I have often been complemented on my calm and helpful demeanour, and believe that I can facilitate direct and effective communcation with any team that I am a part of. I have worked as an editor for a magazine, have regularly been a manager in my more recent roles, and have even worked in direct customer service. 

#### Calm Under Pressure

At Wego Couriers, I would regularly respond to urgent blood transfusion requests, where the difference of a few secounds could result in the tragic loss of a life. I am able to seperate my personal feelings from a working environment if needed in order to see a more objective path to a goal. At Makers, during our Acebook Challenge, I was able to isolate and rectify [a modal bug](https://github.com/AJOsmaston/Acebook-st-bals/commit/68d62ae3a264e668e7e73f67cc125fa4bdf9b084) that was identified 30 minutes before we were due to present our final product, resulting in a flawless final project demonstration.

#### Effective Time Management

From single handedly managing a multi-thousand pound contract with the NHS to quickly respond to the COVID crisis to completing three different engineering projects and ten different weekend challenges at Makers Academy, I am able to organise and manage my time effectively to meet any given deadlines.
