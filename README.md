#### Quick Learner

Whilst working for Wego Couriers, I researched and conducted a full scale profit vs. loss business analysis upon request from our CEO, and was given one month to complete the task. I was able to effectively collect data from across all parts of the business and was able to identify key areas of focus for the company. As a direct result, I saved the company thousands of pounds in direct revenue. At Makers, for our [final project](https://life-of-bernard.herokuapp.com/), I learnt how to use all parts of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React.js and Node.js) in order to create a full stack application. Within 2 weeks, we had successfully implemented a backend that could communicate with a NoSQL database and a front end React application, over both HTTP and HTTPS.

#### Work with an Agile approach

At Wego Couriers, I would regularly respond to urgent blood transfusion requests, where the difference of a few secounds could result in the tragic loss of a life. I once received a phone call requesting immediate support, and was able to dispatch the closest courier to their location, who arrived within 7 minutes. Due to this ability to quickly respond quickly to new developments, the patient survived their operation. At Makers, during our final challenge, we were struggling to get our backend and frontend application to communicate over HTTPS. I was able to learn about secure cookies and implement the working change on my own within two days, and as a result [our project](https://life-of-bernard.herokuapp.com/) was able to communicate flawlessly. 


#### Succinct and Eloquent Communicator

Whether it be clients, customers, members of the general public or conversing with peers, I am able to clearly articulate my thoughts in a polite and thoughtful manner. Whilst working for WEGO Couriers I would regularly communicate with clients in the private and public healthcare industries, liaise with managers of the Train Operating Companies EMR and GWR, and regularly communicate with members of the public and staff of businesses of all size. As a result of this exposure to people working in many different fields, I am able to clearly understand client requests and translate these requests into actionable results.


#### Effective Time Management

Whilst at WEGO Couriers, I was able to single handedly manage a multi-thousand pound contract with the NHS to quickly respond to the COVID crisis, delivering over 500 items across Nottinghamshire within the space of 2 weeks. At Makers Academy, I have completed three different engineering projects and ten different weekend challenges, and as a result believe that I am able to organise and manage my time effectively to meet any given deadline.
